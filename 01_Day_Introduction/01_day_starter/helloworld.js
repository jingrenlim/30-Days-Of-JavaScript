console.log("Hello, World!");

// Start here...
// Introduction to Google Chrome Console
// Shortcut: CMD + Option + J
// Elements: HTML and CSS code found here.
// Console: You can write JS code here and you see JS output here. The browser
// console goes here.
// Sources: Source File you can create snippet code.
// Network: HTTP Request Response cycle found here and anything related to
// network.

// The console is where we wil spend most of our time. The Google Console V8
// engine changes JS code to machine code.
// Console also can be opened using Cmd + Options + I.

// About console.log, console.log can take multiple parameters:
// console.log(params1, params2, params3)
// It will just be printed sequentially...

// About Comments...

// Multiline Comments: /**/

// It is actually possible to write code without console.log in the Console.
// Now refer to index.html
// I will write comments in html.
