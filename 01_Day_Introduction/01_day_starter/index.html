<! There are 4 ways to add JS to a webpage. 
1) Inline script
2) Internal script
3) External script. (Which is preferred to be put in the body.)
4) Multiple external scripts which is just 3) but you have more than one src tags. They are executed in order of how you place the src tags. >
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <title>30DaysOfJavaScript</title>
    <! 2) This shows second method which is internal script tag 
	If you look at the console, it is executed in order. >
    <script>
      console.log("This", "is an internal script!");
    </script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <h1>30DaysOfJavaScript:03 Day</h1>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <! 1) The bottom shows inline script where you can write JS between the button tags 
	>
    <! 2) You can put internal script in head or body but more commonly it will be in the body tags. >
    <script>
      console.log("This", "is an internal script! in the body.");
    </script>
    <button onclick="alert('Welcome to 30DaysOfJavaScript!');">Click Me</button>
    <! 3) External script, use the src tag and point it to the js file in the same directory >
    <script src="./helloworld.js"></script>
    <script src="./introduction.js"></script>
    <script type="module" src="./variable.js"></script>
    <!if it is a module, you have to declare as module.>
    <! only modules can use import and export >
    <script type="module" src="./main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
